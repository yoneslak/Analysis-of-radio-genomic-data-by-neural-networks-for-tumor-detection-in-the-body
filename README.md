Analysis of radiogenomic data by neural networks for 
tumor detection in the body
Summary
A tumor is a common type of cancer. It can manifest itself in the body of 
a person in two cases, benign and malignant. How does it enter the body 
and what can it do in the body?! We will give radiogenomic analysis. In 
this research, our aim is to analyze tumor data by radiogenomic with the 
help of neural network. Radiogenomics can understand the type of 
cancer and how far it has progressed in the human body by analyzing 
data from the patient's MRI. We are going to take this data to the 
prediction stage with the help of neural network (ANN). Since 
Radiogenomic is not able to regression the data, and it cannot give us a 
more efficient prediction in the field of the resulting tumor in the body. 
We have to consider a training model for this work. We to have better 
results with high quality of data with this training model. In this model, 
which gives us most of the states 0 and 1, the closer we are to stage 0, in 
this case, our tumor will move towards the benign state, and the more it 
moves towards 1, the state it will be malignant.
But it should also be noted that radiogenomic and neural networks have 
a close relationship. And that both of them use ML to analyze and 
predict their experimental data. And this proximity provides us with the 
connection between these two directions in our use of radiogenomic data 
by neural networks.
Definitions:
1. Radiogenomics:
1.1: Radiogenomics refers to the analytical process, which aims to link 
cancer imaging features with genomic data.
1.2: Radiogenomic represents the evolution related to radiologyï¿¾pathology from the tissue level to the subcellular level.
1.3: Radiogenomic, in its simplest form, can be said to refer to the 
relationship between imaging features of a disease and its gene, 
expression patterns, gene mutations and other features related to the 
patient's gene.
In this section, we present three different and comprehensible definitions 
of radiogenomic. The point of similarity in these three definitions is the 
patient's gene. All three definitions emphasize the genome resulting 
from the tumor disease in the individual's body. So the turning point in 
the calculations related to Radiogenomic data will be related to the 
genomicity of the individual. Of course, we intend to provide the 
definitions related to the neural network in this part of the research.
2. Neural networks (NN):
2.1: A neural networks is a set of interconnected neurons that are placed 
in the body to perform certain operations.
The figure related to the connection of neurons
2.2: Neural networks are one or more layers of neurons stacked on each 
other. Each neuron's output is another neuron's input.
The figure related to the layers of the neural network
2.3: Neural networks are composed of neurons communicating with 
each other to coordinate other body parts with each other.
3. Artificial neural networks (ANN):
3.1: Artificial neural networks are a type of network inspired by the 
biological brain of living organisms, especially humans.
3.2: Artificial neural networks, consisting of a type of neuron and node 
with net weights, are suitable for forming the output.
3.3: Neural network refers to a set of sub-branches of artificial 
intelligence derived from the human biological brain, which is usually 
based on calculations
